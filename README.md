## Description

The Website 'Weather Wardrobe' utilizes a weather API to gather current weather information and images of clothing items to suggest the general outfit based on the current weather conditions. The website allows users to input their location, then the app then uses the current temperature, precipitation, and other weather data to suggest an appropriate outfit. With its user-friendly interface and accurate weather-based suggestions, Weather Wardrobe makes getting dressed in the morning a breeze.

## Usage

To use this website, follow these steps:

1. Enter your city in the search bar on the home page.
2. Press the "Get Weather" button.
3. The website will display the current weather conditions for your city, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.
4. Scroll down to see the 7-day weather forecast for your city, including high and low temperatures and chance of precipitation.
5. Based on the weather forecast, the website will recommend clothing for you to wear each day of the week. The clothing recommendations will include both text descriptions and pictures to help you visualize what to wear. For example, if the weather is expected to be sunny and warm, the website might recommend shorts, a t-shirt, and sunglasses for that day.

Note: The clothing recommendations are based on general weather conditions and may not be suitable for everyone's individual preferences or needs. Please use your own judgement when deciding what to wear.
